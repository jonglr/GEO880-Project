## Abstract

This project aims to identify different types of active movement based on personal GPS data. By integrating additional data from Swiss TLM3D, which includes detailed information on street networks and hiking paths, we aim to accurately classify movement types based on GPS-derived features such as speed, elevation change, distance measures, and month of activity. The classification is performed using a decision tree model in R Studio. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated using predictive validation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The validation is performed using personal GPS data such as hiking, jogging, ski-touring, and cycling that were collected via the Strava app over a period of 3 months. 

## Introduction

This report is part of the semster project of the course "Patterns and trends in environmental data" offered by ZHAW. Goal of the project was to develop exploratory data science skills and be able to work with your own data in the software environment R. As part of this project, we have designed and implemented basic data science procedures and critically evaluated the data. 

### Background

The increasing availability of personal GPS devices and fitness tracking applications has opened new avenues for analyzing movement patterns (@passler2022). Understanding the types of physical activities performed by individuals can provide valuable insights into fitness behavior, urban mobility, and environmental interactions (@zhang2023). This study focuses on leveraging GPS data to classify different types of active movements: hiking, jogging, ski-touring, and cycling.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust model that can classify different types of active movement using GPS data. We aim to:


- Integrate GPS data with additional geographic information from Swiss TLM3D.
- Extract and process relevant features from the GPS data.
- Build and evaluate a decision tree model for movement classification.

### Research Question

In this context we are aiming to answer the following research questions: 

- How accurately can we identify movement types/modes based on GPS data features such as speed, elevation change, distance measures or month of activity?
- What are the challenges in distinguishing between similar modes (e.g. jogging & biking)?


## Material and Methods

This chapter outlines the data collection, processing techniques, and the classification model used in this study.

### Data Collection

#### GPS Data
The GPS data for this study were collected using the Strava app, a popular platform for tracking various physical activities. The data includes timestamps, latitude, longitude, and elevation points for activities categorized as hiking, jogging, ski-touring, and cycling.

#### Swiss TLM3D Data
Swiss TLM3D provides comprehensive geographic data, including detailed information on street networks and hiking paths. This data is crucial for contextualizing the GPS tracks and enhancing feature extraction.

### Data Processing

#### Data Loading
The first step involves loading the GPX files from Strava and transforming them to a common coordinate system using Swiss TLM3D data. This ensures consistency in the spatial representation of the data. 

#### Cleaning and Interpolation
Data cleaning involves removing outliers that could skew the analysis. For instance, sudden jumps in GPS coordinates that are not physically plausible are filtered out. Additionally, the GPS tracks are interpolated to a consistent time interval, adjusting Strava tracks to 3-second intervals, to standardize the data points for analysis.
Additionally, the street data has been reduced to avoid a huge data load. This involved the combination of all GPX tracks into a single sf object. After that, we have used a buffer of 1 km (1000 meters) around the combined tracks
and later combined all buffers into a single geometry.After that the street network has been filtered to keep only the streets within the buffer.

### Feature Engineering
In a next step, key features were defined to characterize the movement types. These include:

- Speed (cross scale): Calculating speed over different scales:
  - Average Speed: Mean speed over the duration of the activity for all segments.
  - Maximum Speed: The highest speed that was reached during the activity for all segments.
  - Speed Variance: the mean variance of speed during the activity for all segments. 
- Elevation Change: Total elevation gain and loss.
- Street & hiking path Distance: total distance to street and hiking path network.
- Temporal Measures: Seasonality of the activity.

For each of these features, functions were defined for further usage. 

#### Speed Calculation
A function named calculate_speed was defined to compute the speed of movement based on GPS data. This function sorts the GPS track data by time to ensure chronological order. It then calculates the distance between consecutive points using the st_distance function. The time difference between these points is also computed. Speed is derived by dividing the distance by the time difference and converting it to kilometers per hour (km/h). To handle the last row, which might have NA values due to the lack of a subsequent point, the function replaces these NA values with zeros. The function is applied to each element in the list sf_obj_clean, resulting in the list sf_obj_speed containing tracks with calculated speed values.

#### Elevation Change Calculation
The calculate_elevation_change function calculates the change in elevation for each point in the track by subtracting the elevation of the previous point from the current point. This function is applied to each element in the sf_obj_speed list, resulting in the list sf_obj_elev that includes tracks with elevation change data.

#### Distance to Street and Hiking Paths
Two subsets of street data are defined based on different criteria: subset1 includes various types of streets, while subset2 includes hiking paths. A function calculate_nearest_distance calculates the nearest distance from each point in the track to the nearest point in a given street subset. This function is first applied using subset1 to compute the distance to streets, and then using subset2 to compute the distance to hiking paths. The results are stored in the list sf_obj_dist.

#### Adding Month Information
The add_month_column function extracts the month from the timestamp of each point and adds it as a new column to the track data. This function is applied to each element in the sf_obj_dist list, resulting in the list sf_obj_month that includes tracks with month information.

#### Data Exploration
Initial data exploration includes generating plots and visualizations to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data. This step helps identify any anomalies and provides insights into the patterns associated with different activities. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves several steps to prepare and visualize the data for further insights. The first step in the EDA process involves combining all individual data frames into a single data frame. Each data frame corresponds to a track and is stored in a dedicated list with a new column with an indentifier attribute to identify each track. The functions were then plotted for each attribute before arranging and saving the plots as shown in the figure 1 below.

### Classification Model
A decision tree model was selected for its simplicity and interpretability, which are critical for understanding and communicating the results of our classification task. Decision trees offer several advantages that make them particularly suitable for this study, where we aim to classify types of active movement based on GPS data features (@shamoun-baranes2012). 
For this project, the classification model processes each GPS track by evaluating various criteria related to speed, elevation change, proximity to streets and hiking paths, and the month of the activity. Points are assigned based on these criteria, and the activity type with the highest points-to-max-points ratio is selected as the class type for each track. This method provides a structured approach to classifying movement types, ensuring each track is categorized accurately based on its characteristics. We used the previously defined features as criteria evaluation: 

- Speed: Points are assigned based on the speed range.
  - Speed > 15 km/h adds points to cycling.
  - Speed between 5 and 15 km/h adds points to running.
  - Speed between 2 and 5 km/h adds points to hiking.
- Elevation: Points are assigned based on the absolute elevation change.
  - Elevation < 0.1 adds points to running.
  - Elevation between 0.1 and 0.4 adds points to both ski-touring and hiking.
  - Elevation > 0.4 adds points to cycling.
- Street Distance: Points are assigned based on the distance to the nearest street.
  - Distance > 100 meters adds points to hiking and ski-touring.
  - Distance <= 100 meters adds points to running and cycling.
- Hiking Path Distance: Points are assigned based on the distance to the nearest hiking path.
  - Distance > 1000 meters adds points to running and cycling.
  - Distance <= 1000 meters adds points to hiking and ski-touring.
- Month: Points are assigned based on the month.
  - Months 11, 12, 1-5 add points to ski-touring.
  - Months 6-10 add points to hiking and cycling.

Additionally, we have defined 3 checks to invalidate movement types if the the threshold were not realistic. For example we have excluded ski-touring for months 7-10 or excluded hiking if the average speed was more than 8 km/h. Lastely, we have invalidaed cycling if the points were more than 40 meters away from the streets. 

In a last step, the ration od points to maximum possible points for each activity has been calculated, and the activity type with the highest ration has been assigned as the class type for the track. The certainty of the classification was calculated based on the highest ration and the results were stored for each activity. the results were added as "classified_tracks" in the list. 

### Evaluation
The evaluation process involves combining classified track data, calculating a confusion matrix, and deriving key performance metrics for each class. This structured approach provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, offering valuable insights into its performance across different movement types. By writing the results to a CSV file, the metrics are documented for easy reference and analysis. The following values were used as performance metrics (@openai2023): 

- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
- Precision: The proportion of true positive classifications among all positive classifications.
- Recall: The proportion of true positive classifications among all actual positives.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Discussion

More feature criteria could have been involved. FOr example the combination of average speed and elevation, speed variance and elevation, average speed and stop frequency, as well as speed variance and stop frequency might have.
